# Testing Vertx 3.0.0

This is a simple project for testing out [Vert.x 3](http://vertx.io/).

Much of this code is taken from the vertx documentation, example
files, and blogs. See, for example:
 
http://vertx.io/blog/my-first-vert-x-3-application/index.html

You can build it by running:

    ./gradlew shadowJar
